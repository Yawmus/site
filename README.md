Personal website - under construction!

## Sat Dec 11

Design decisions when making a new website. Right now I'm looking to have github host my personal project yet again. What are the implications of this?

Looks like Github provides _Themes_ to work with out-of-the-box.

I selected Minimal
`Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your repository settings. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll _config.yml configuration file.`
